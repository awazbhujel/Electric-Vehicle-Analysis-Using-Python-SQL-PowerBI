## Project Objectives

1. **Understand Electric Vehicle Adoption:** Gain insights into the adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) by analyzing registration data.
2. **Identify Geographic Trends:** Determine the geographical distribution of EV registrations to understand regional preferences.
3. **Analyze Vehicle Characteristics:** Investigate the features and specifications of EVs, such as electric range and manufacturer.
4. **Provide Recommendations:** Offer recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis to promote sustainable transportation initiatives.
5. **Create Interactive Dashboard:** Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing the analysis results.

## About Dataset

The dataset provides information on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):** Fully electric vehicles that run solely on electric power stored in batteries.
- **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):** Hybrid vehicles with both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.

### Dataset Link:

### Columns in the Dataset:

- **VIN:** Partial vehicle identification number consisting of the first 10 digits.
- **County, City, State, Postal Code:** Registration location details.
- **Model Year, Make, Model:** Vehicle manufacturing details.
- **Electric Vehicle Type:** BEV or PHEV.
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility:** Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle benefits.
- **Electric Range:** Range of the vehicle on a full electric charge.
- **Base MSRP:** Manufacturer's suggested retail price.
- **Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, Electric Utility, 2020 Census Tract:** Additional registration details.


## Steps for Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from Kaggle Websites

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. Normalize, transform, and aggregate data as necessary.

3. **Data Analysis with Python (EDA):** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Analyze patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

4. **Analysis with SQL:** Utilize SQL queries to extract and manipulate data stored in relational databases. Compare values, calculate statistics, and perform additional analysis.

5. **Power BI Dashboard:** Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize findings. Connect to data sources, design data models, and add interactivity for end-users.

6. **Insights and Recommendations:** Draw conclusions and provide insights into the electric vehicle market. Make recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis.
